  CHAPTERONE: `> I'm a scholar who has spent years studying the art of necromancy, and I've come to believe there are far more things in this world than we think. As such, it was inevitable that I would seek out answers in the great beyond—or rather, the afterlife. There, I discovered a vast array of spirits, many of them possessing unique abilities and talents. They're eager to help us mortals on Earth, so long as you can provide them with something they want. In exchange, these spirits will give you their undivided attention and guidance, and might even lend you some of their supernatural abilities! The opportunities for fame and fortune and, yes, even immortality—it's all out there, waiting for those who dare to take it.

> I stood before an ornate portal that glowed green. On the surface, I had expected any gateway to lead directly into some bizarre part of my own mind or the ethers of death itself. Instead, I found myself in what looked like a pleasant courtyard filled with beautiful blossoms, trees, bushes, and flowers that bloomed between carved columns. Halcyon was thriving, the people were living in such blissful contentment, and yet every detail in that courtyard seemed just so. It was breathtakingly beautiful, and only a few steps away from being frightening. My companion, Spink, had no idea how to react to it. He simply stared around, Spink was one of the spirits I regularly made contact with in order to assist me in my research. Spink couldn't quite reconcile himself to his situation, for he did not have the normal sensibilities and outlook that other men do. His entire existence consisted of solitude, tedium, and painful injuries. Yet he was as quick as a snake in trying to change my perspective when he thought it would be helpful. Today, I thought it best to focus his attention on life instead of death. "Spink, could you tell me what kind of flowers those are, gesturing toward a patch of tranquil purple and white ones? We call them Hyacinths here."
> "Yes, Master Healer, I recognize those plants. Our Changer is fond of hyacinths; she grows them near her garden at home."

> My Spink's features transformed, becoming almost human in his eagerness to share knowledge. Perhaps too eager. This is one reason why I took him on, instead of asking others. But then, that was the point, wasn't it? To learn how to communicate with the afterlife.`,
